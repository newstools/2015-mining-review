Welcome to 2015 and the first edition of Mining Review Africa’s first annual ‘Mining Elites in Africa: Suppliers & service providers yearbook’, officially sponsored by African mining engineering expert, DRA. When you enter the final stages of putting together an annual, the sense of accomplishment is overwhelming, especially in this instance. I have worked on many annuals during my publishing years so far, but nothing to date quite compares to the satisfaction I feel in presenting to you the book you hold in your hands right now. ‘Mining Elites in Africa’ is the result of many long and hard hours of team strategising, working to conceptualise a product that has reader value and will prove an asset to any mining professional’s bookshelf and frequent referral. And this is it!
